This project is not going to become a library itself. It is intended to be a proof of concept showing that:
	animation matrices can be exported from an external tool
	those animation matrices can be utilized easily in this project

unstable - Works completely fine. uses an animation made in blender (stored in animation.json) as well as a model made in blender (stored in some .obj file idk what it's called)
	CONTROLS: Scroll wheel to scrub animation
			wasd to move around (always looking at origin)
